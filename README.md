# web-dev-portfolio

This is my portfolio project for my Web Development course at Oregon State University.

It's a full-stack MERN web app with CRUD capabilities.

On the website, there's 2 pages detailing what I learned in the course, and a page where users can view a master playlist. Users can edit, delete, or add songs to the playlist.

I deployed the website on Heroku; you can view the website here: https://peaceful-garden-50865-38f139461e0d.herokuapp.com
